						We invite tutorial proposals for the 23rd European Agent Systems Summer School, 
						which will be hosted by <a href="https://www.cs.ucd.ie">School of Computer Science</a> at
						<a href="https://www.ucd.ie">University College Dublin</a>, Ireland from August 19th 
						until 23rd, 2024.						
					</p>
					<p>
						Since 1999, the annual European Agent Systems Summer School (EASSS) has provided a
						highly successful forum for knowledge exchange between researchers in the field of
						autonomous agents and multi-agent systems.
						As was the case with the earlier editions, EASSS 2024 will offer a rich program of
						both introductory and advanced courses on a broad range of topics in the area of 
						Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems. The courses will be taught by leading
						researchers in the field, and are aimed at advanced Masters students, PhD students,
						and other young researchers.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are interested in tutorial proposals in all areas of current research in Autonomous
						Agents and Multi-Agent Systems. As a very rough guideline, any topic that might be 
						covered at the AAMAS conference or in the JAAMAS journal would be suitable for EASSS.
						We aim for a mix of tutorials on fundamental and well-established topics, as well as
						overviews of new and emerging areas of research.
						Tutorials should cover an appropriate selection of approaches and not specifically 
						focus on the tutors' own contributions. Besides providing a coherent overview of a 
						specific research topic, we specifically encourage tutorial proposals to articulate 
						a clear link to applications and pragmatic consideration of the fundamental topics
						presented.
					</p>
					<p>
						EASSS tutorials are typically 3 hours long, divided into two sessions of 90 minutes each.
						For the detailed call for tutorials, please see below.
						We encourage both well-established senior researchers and younger colleagues to submit
						proposals. Each tutorial is usually given by one or two tutors. Exceptions are of course
						possible; for proposals by more than two tutors, please justify this choice in the
						proposal and explain how you intend to ensure the coherence of the tutorial.					
						To support the tutors, we can commit to the provision of up to 500 EUR per tutorial to
						cover the travel and accommodation costs.						
					</p>
					<h4>Submission Instructions</h4>
					<p>
						A tutorial proposal should take the form of a single PDF document covering the points 
						listed below. The <b>maximum length of the proposal is 2 pages</b>, and the use of our
						<a href="proposal.tex">LaTeX template</a> is mandatory.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following points should be addressed in the tutorial proposal, preferably in the order
						stated below:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Title of the proposed tutorial.</li>
						<li>Tutor(s): name, affiliation, full contact details, and a link to the personal homepage of each tutor.</li>
						<li>Abstract: a short paragraph describing the tutorial (100-300 words), suitable for publication at the EASSS 2024 website.</li>
						<li>Topics covered: detailed list of topics covered in the tutorial in terms of a list, preferably in the order in which the tutorial will cover them.</li>
						<li>Type: a clear indication of whether the tutorial takes a theoretical or applications-oriented perspective on the topics covered. We encourage tutorial proposals that balance the two perspectives.</li>
						<li>Level: please indicate the target audience and level of the course. If there are prerequisites, describe what knowledge will be assumed by the tutorial.</li>
						<li>Teaching materials: Please indicate what kind of teaching materials you intend to provide. Note that we will require materials by the date above, so that they can be distributed to EASSS attendees in advance.</li>
						<li>Duration: Tutorials are typically 3 hours long. If you have good reasons for wanting to deviate from this standard, please explain this in your proposal.</li>

								<b>RL Keynote: From Deep Reinforcement Learning to LLM-based Agents: Perspectives on Current Research</b><br/>
								<i>Associate Professor Stefano V. Albrecht</i><br/>
								Since the recent successes of large language models (LLMs), we are beginning to see a shift of 
								attention from deep reinforcement learning to LLM-based agents. While deep RL policies are 
								typically learned from scratch to maximise some defined return objective, LLM-agents use an 
								existing LLM at their core and focus on clever prompt engineering and downstream specialisation 
								of the LLM via supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. In this talk, I will first 
								provide a broad overview of my groupâ€™s research in deep RL, which focuses among other topics 
								on developing sample-efficient and robust RL algorithms for both single- and multi-agent 
								control tasks, including industry applications in autonomous driving and multi-robot warehouses. 
								I will then present our recent research into LLM-agents, where we propose an approach for 
								household robotics that takes into account user preferences to achieve more robust and 
								effective planning. I will conclude with some personal observations about the state of 
								LLM-agent research: (a) many papers in this field follow essentially the same recipe by 
								focussing on prompt engineering and downstream specialisation; (b) this recipe makes their 
								scientific claims brittle as they depend crucially on the specific LMM engine, and (c) LLMs
								are not natively designed to maximise objectives for optimal control and decision making. Based
								on these observations, I believe some fruitful research avenues can be identified.

						<h4>Tutorials</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Tutorial 1: Deep Reinforcement Learning: Foundations and Practical Environment Setup for Real-
								World Applications</b><br/>
								This tutorial delves into the field of reinforcement learning (RL), a specialized area of
								machine learning focused on developing autonomous agents that behave optimally within
								specific environments. The tutorial will begin by covering fundamental RL concepts such
								as agents, environments, and learning paradigms, before discussing why deep learning is
								increasingly employed to solve complex, high-dimensional decision-making challenges.
								The session will introduce two principal types of deep RL algorithms: value-based and
								policy-based methods, each underscored by their respective applications and benefits.
								Following the theoretical overview, the tutorial will transition into a hands-on component
								where participants will learn to set up a training environment tailored for RL agents.
								This part of the tutorial will include a practical introduction to OpenAIâ€™s Gym library and
								references to prominent libraries that implement deep RL algorithms. We will wrap up by
								tackling common deep RL challenges, such as managing the balance between exploration
								and exploitation and overcoming convergence issues. This comprehensive approach will
								provide attendees with the foundational knowledge necessary to initiate their own RL
								environments for custom projects.<br/>

							<li><b>Tutorial 2: Continual Learning</b><br/>
								Continual learning is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence, focusing on the
								ability of agents to learn continuously from a stream of data while retaining previously ac-
								quired knowledge. This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of continual learning

								techniques, ranging from theoretical foundations to practical applications. Participants
								will gain insights into the latest advancements in this field and learn how to address the
								issues of catastrophic forgetting and model stability. Through hands-on exercises and
								case studies, attendees will explore how continual learning can be applied to real-world
								problems in various domains.<br/>

							<li><b>Tutorial 3: Current Trends in Argumentation Dynamics</b><br/>
								Abstract argumentation is a simple model for representing conflicting pieces of information
								and reasoning from it. In particular, it can be used to model debates (e.g. for
								deliberation or negotiation) between several agents. In this tutorial, we will review the
								basic notions of abstract argumentation, and then focus on argumentation dynamics. This
								topic has received much attention in the last 15 years, with two main types of research
								questions: 1. given an information about the acceptability of arguments, how can we
								modify the argumentation framework to comply with this information? 2. given a mod-
								ification of the argumentation framework, what is the impact of this modification on the
								acceptability of arguments? The first question is related to strategic aspects (how can an
								agent convince her opponent to agree with her?), while the second question is mainly
								about computational aspects (how can we re-compute efficiently the acceptability status
								of arguments?). We will present the main contributions about both these questions, motivated
								by applications in the domain of (argument-based) automated negotiation.<br/>

							<li><b>Tutorial 4: Engineering Safe Multiagent Systems: an Introduction to Formal and Runtime Verifica-
								tion of Agents and MAS</b><br/>
								In this tutorial we will discuss the importance of properly engineering agents and MAS, and
								we will introduce formal verification as a means to engineer safe systems. We will hence in-
								troduce the notions of formal and semi-formal verification, with special attention to runtime

								verification, and we will provide an overview on the literature on this topic, to clarify the
								context and the achieved results. Finally, we will go into the details of runtime verification
								of MAS, exploiting the RML Runtime Monitoring Language1 as a tool for showing demos
								and examples.<br/>
								<b><i>Tutor: Professor Viviana Mascardi, Professor Davide Ancona, Professor Angelo Ferrando</i></b>
							</li>
							<li><b>Tutorial 5: Game-Theoretic Verification of Multi-Agent Systems</b><br/>
								Formal verification addresses the issue of correctness, which is a fundamental concern in
								computer science. In the context of multi-agent systems, rational verification is a game-
								theoretic counterpart of the conventional formal verification of computing systems. The
								rational verification problem is concerned with checking which properties will hold in
								a system when its constituent agents are assumed to behave rationally in pursuit of in-
								dividual objectives. In this tutorial, we will introduce the fundamental framework for
								rational verification, including concepts such as models of games, temporal logic, model
								and equilibrium checking problems, and the Reactive Modules modelling language. We
								will also present EVE, a formal verification tool that can be used to solve the most impor-
								tant decision problems in rational verification. We will show how we can model examples
								of multi-agent systems and use EVE to verify some given properties.<br/>

					<h3>Local Information</h3>
					<p>
						Please find information on the venue and accomodation.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h4>The Venue</h4>
					</p>
					<p>
						UCD is one of Europe's leading research-intensive universities; an environment 
						where undergraduate education, masters and PhD training, research, innovation 
						and community engagement form a dynamic spectrum of activity. UCDs main campus is
						an extensive parkland estate of 133 hectares in South Dublin. Details of available
						transport links can be found <a href="https://www.myucd.ie/visiting-ucd/transport-links/">here</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The venue for the summer school is the <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/cs">UCD School of Computer Science</a>.
						This is labelled as building 18 on the map below.
						on the map below.

					</p>
					<p>
						<h4>Leap Card</h4>
					</p>
					<p>
						<img src="images/leap.jpg" style="height:120px;float:right"/>
						Leap Cards are a prepaid travel card that is the easiest way to pay your fare on public transport around Ireland. It
						is valid on most TFI services and commercial bus operators throughout Ireland. Itâ€™s more convenient because you donâ€™t 
						have to carry cash or queue at ticket machines and it can save you money because fares are usually up to 30% less 
						than cash single tickets.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>TFI 90 Minute Fare</b><br/>
						When you have a leap card, you can travel anywhere in Dublin for 90 minutes for just &euro;2. This includes all
						Dublin Bus, Go-Ahead Ireland, the Luas (tram) and the DART/Commuter Services (local train).
					</p>
					<p>
						<h4>Accommodation Options</h4>
					</p>
					<p>
						Much of the local accommodation is available through <a href="https://booking.com">Booking.com</a>.  Occassionally, you
						can find better deals on their own websites.
					</p>
					<p>
