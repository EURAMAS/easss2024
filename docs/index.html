						We invite tutorial proposals for the 23rd European Agent Systems Summer School, 
						which will be hosted by <a href="https://www.cs.ucd.ie">School of Computer Science</a> at
						<a href="https://www.ucd.ie">University College Dublin</a>, Ireland from August 19th 
						until 23rd, 2024.						
					</p>
					<p>
						Since 1999, the annual European Agent Systems Summer School (EASSS) has provided a
						highly successful forum for knowledge exchange between researchers in the field of
						autonomous agents and multi-agent systems.
						As was the case with the earlier editions, EASSS 2024 will offer a rich program of
						both introductory and advanced courses on a broad range of topics in the area of 
						Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems. The courses will be taught by leading
						researchers in the field, and are aimed at advanced Masters students, PhD students,
						and other young researchers.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are interested in tutorial proposals in all areas of current research in Autonomous
						Agents and Multi-Agent Systems. As a very rough guideline, any topic that might be 
						covered at the AAMAS conference or in the JAAMAS journal would be suitable for EASSS.
						We aim for a mix of tutorials on fundamental and well-established topics, as well as
						overviews of new and emerging areas of research.
						Tutorials should cover an appropriate selection of approaches and not specifically 
						focus on the tutors' own contributions. Besides providing a coherent overview of a 
						specific research topic, we specifically encourage tutorial proposals to articulate 
						a clear link to applications and pragmatic consideration of the fundamental topics
						presented.
					</p>
					<p>
						EASSS tutorials are typically 3 hours long, divided into two sessions of 90 minutes each.
						For the detailed call for tutorials, please see below.
						We encourage both well-established senior researchers and younger colleagues to submit
						proposals. Each tutorial is usually given by one or two tutors. Exceptions are of course
						possible; for proposals by more than two tutors, please justify this choice in the
						proposal and explain how you intend to ensure the coherence of the tutorial.					
						To support the tutors, we can commit to the provision of up to 500 EUR per tutorial to
						cover the travel and accommodation costs.						
					</p>
					<h4>Submission Instructions</h4>
					<p>
						A tutorial proposal should take the form of a single PDF document covering the points 
						listed below. The <b>maximum length of the proposal is 2 pages</b>, and the use of our
						<a href="proposal.tex">LaTeX template</a> is mandatory.
					</p>
					<p>

						<h4>Tutorials</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Tutorial 1: Deep Reinforcement Learning: Foundations and Practical Environment Setup for Real-
								World Applications</b><br/>
								This tutorial delves into the field of reinforcement learning (RL), a specialized area of
								machine learning focused on developing autonomous agents that behave optimally within
								specific environments. The tutorial will begin by covering fundamental RL concepts such
								as agents, environments, and learning paradigms, before discussing why deep learning is
								increasingly employed to solve complex, high-dimensional decision-making challenges.
								The session will introduce two principal types of deep RL algorithms: value-based and
								policy-based methods, each underscored by their respective applications and benefits.
								Following the theoretical overview, the tutorial will transition into a hands-on component
								where participants will learn to set up a training environment tailored for RL agents.
								This part of the tutorial will include a practical introduction to OpenAIâ€™s Gym library and
								references to prominent libraries that implement deep RL algorithms. We will wrap up by
								tackling common deep RL challenges, such as managing the balance between exploration
								and exploitation and overcoming convergence issues. This comprehensive approach will
								provide attendees with the foundational knowledge necessary to initiate their own RL
								environments for custom projects.<br/>
								<b><i>Tutor: Franco Terranova, University of Lorraine</i></b>
							</li>
							<li><b>Tutorial 2: Continual Learning</b><br/>
								Continual learning is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence, focusing on the
								ability of agents to learn continuously from a stream of data while retaining previously ac-
								quired knowledge. This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of continual learning

								techniques, ranging from theoretical foundations to practical applications. Participants
								will gain insights into the latest advancements in this field and learn how to address the
								issues of catastrophic forgetting and model stability. Through hands-on exercises and
								case studies, attendees will explore how continual learning can be applied to real-world
								problems in various domains.<br/>
								<b><i>Tutor: Andrii Krutsylo, Polish Academy of Sciences</i></b>

							<li><b>Tutorial 3: XXX</b><br/>
								Description goes here<br/>
								<b><i>Tutor: Dr No</i></b>
							</li>
							<li><b>Tutorial 4: Engineering Safe Multiagent Systems: an Introduction to Formal and Runtime Verifica-
								tion of Agents and MAS</b><br/>
								In this tutorial we will discuss the importance of properly engineering agents and MAS, and
								we will introduce formal verification as a means to engineer safe systems. We will hence in-
								troduce the notions of formal and semi-formal verification, with special attention to runtime

								verification, and we will provide an overview on the literature on this topic, to clarify the
								context and the achieved results. Finally, we will go into the details of runtime verification
								of MAS, exploiting the RML Runtime Monitoring Language1 as a tool for showing demos
								and examples.<br/>
								<b><i>Tutor: Professor Viviana Mascardi, Professor Davide Ancona, Professor Angelo Ferrando</i></b>
							</li>
							<li><b>Tutorial 5: Game-Theoretic Verification of Multi-Agent Systems</b><br/>
								Formal verification addresses the issue of correctness, which is a fundamental concern in
								computer science. In the context of multi-agent systems, rational verification is a game-
								theoretic counterpart of the conventional formal verification of computing systems. The
								rational verification problem is concerned with checking which properties will hold in
								a system when its constituent agents are assumed to behave rationally in pursuit of in-
								dividual objectives. In this tutorial, we will introduce the fundamental framework for
								rational verification, including concepts such as models of games, temporal logic, model
								and equilibrium checking problems, and the Reactive Modules modelling language. We
								will also present EVE, a formal verification tool that can be used to solve the most impor-
								tant decision problems in rational verification. We will show how we can model examples
								of multi-agent systems and use EVE to verify some given properties.<br/>
